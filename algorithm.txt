Algorithm for VDS air brake deployment.

Definitions:
- Percent of deployed surface area: the percent of the total air brake surface area that is 
outside the vehicle.

Parameters:
(1) Subalgorithm: Determination of launch detection
    - This is how the system determines that launch has been detected.
(2) Subalgorithm: Determination of motor burnout
    - This is how the system determines that motor burnout has completed.
    - Options:
        - Constant wait. 
(3) Subalgorithm: Air brake deployment incrementation algorithm
    - This is the algorithm which determines how much of the air brake to deploy when the 
    main algorithm determines that it needs to change the deployed surface area. 
    - Options:
        - Simple incrementation. If the main algorithm needs to increase surface area, this 
        scheme simply increments or decrements the air brake surface area deployed by some fixed amount.
        - Calculated incrementation. If the main deployment algorithm needs 
(4) Integer: Desired apogee
    - This is the apogee that the air brake is trying to achieve
(5) Subalgorithm: Data barrier to actuation
    - This defines how long the air brake must wait beyond motor burnout to begin actuating
    in reaction to sensor readings. This is to ensure that data collection will yield an accurate
    model for apogee prediction.
    - Options:
        - Wait until n data points have been collected
        - Wait for n second(s) of data collection
(6) Subalgorithm: Apogee prediction

Main Algorithm:
(1) Wait for launch to be detected. If launch is detected, proceed to step 2.
(2) Wait for motor burnout to be detected. If motor burnout is detected, proceed to step 3.
(3) Wait to overcome the data barrier to actuation. If barrier has been passed, proceed to step 4.
(4) Calculate predicted apogee from apogee prediction model. 
    (a) If predicted apogee is less than target apogee, proceed to step 4. 
    (b) If predicted apogee is equal to target apogee, proceed to step 4.
    (c)If predicted apogee is greater than target apogee, proceed to step 5.
(5) Deploy percent air brake based on incrementation algorithm.
